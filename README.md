**Welcome to the NashCalc Prototype** 

**Let's Fix Shit Up!**

**Basically name your commit whatever the task name is and update the README, removing it from your assignments**

**Key Tasks:**
  
  **Ben:**  
  
    Numpy manipulation methods do not work for arrays of dimensions 2+/2+ as they become too nested (find a universal way to round and get absolute values) 
    
    Get example data from the forms and leave commented above the function for testing
    
    Make solvenasheq output human readable from existing arrays
  
    Eliminate axios api calls anytime that form values are not complete and numbers/floats and move error handling from axios to when call condition is met/unmet 
  
    Highlight the form if it's a nash eq in pure or highlight the others on a gradient of color depending on probability in mixed strategies (can pass a state down to the form)
  
    Fix logic for setting row and column floor on buttons 
  
    Update routes to /api/... to make it more cooperative with router and deploy 
  
    Deploy to nashcalc.com
    
  **Ganesh:**
    
     Responsive static header (fix the spacing problem) -- should just be there no fancy stuff yet 
        Finish tutorial here: https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-basic-header-with-materialui-and-react-js-d650f75b4b0a + next tutorial 
  
  **Unassigned (take what you want and throw it under your name):** 

    Animate adding or removing form cards 
    
    Affix row and col buttons to position on page so they don't move when things are scaled 
    
    Add styling of form 
    
    Scale cards properly 
    
    Make a nice logo maybe (see what we have the rights to do) 
    
    Zoom in and out like google sheets ui: https://blog.logrocket.com/building-inline-editable-ui-in-react/
    
    Buttons are no longer styled and need to be redone (perhaps with the floating action buttons) 
    
    When rows exceed height of screen everything scrolls down whereas when columns exceed width everything gets screwed up and they tend to wrap around 
      Get rid of this behavior and make it such that the whole thing can scroll horizontally to account for width expansion 
  
  **Future Features:** 
  
    Take a look at gambit + other libraries for future feature ideas / opportunities 
      
  **Approximate feature roadmap:**
