**Welcome to the NashCalc Prototype** 

**Let's Fix Shit Up!**

**Basically name your commit whatever the task name is and update the README, removing it from your assignments** 

**Resources:**

  This might be helpful for us both with phase 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgKH12s_95A

**Key Tasks:**
  
  **Ben:**  
  
    Responsive static header (fix the spacing problem) -- should just be there no fancy stuff yet 
    
        Force form default "( , )" comma separated parentheses using text mask https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/componentDocumentation.md#readme via a regex-based mask function 
    
  **Ganesh:**
    
    Python middle-end bridge with Django (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Xi7x4G7yg)
  
  **Unassigned (take what you want and throw it under your name):** 

    Animate adding or removing form cards 
    
    gambit solve for nash eq 
    
    Affix row and col buttons to position on page so they don't move when things are scaled 
    
    Add styling of form 
    
    Scale cards properly 
    
    Make a nice logo maybe (see what we have the rights to do) 
    
    Zoom in and out like google sheets ui: https://blog.logrocket.com/building-inline-editable-ui-in-react/
  
    We have form input data being returned from Form being passed to Grid 
    What we need to do is process it in Grid and save in array format with defined indexes (where they're coming from)
    Each Grid element needs to report its index
  
  **Future Features:** 
  
    Take a look at nashpy and gambit + other libraries for future feature ideas / opportunities 
      -note that the manner in which we use the python bridge means that we'll have access to other game theory libraries for other features that will all be handled behind the scenes
