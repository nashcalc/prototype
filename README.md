**Key Tasks:**
  
  **Ben:**  
  
  
    Highlight or color the form if it's a nash eq in pure or highlight the others on a gradient of color depending on probability in mixed strategies (can pass a state down to the form)
    -- unfortunately APP.js sends string to grid and needs to send array ): 
  
    Eliminate axios api calls anytime that form values are not complete and numbers/floats and move error handling from axios to when call condition is met/unmet
    as opposed to just error handling 
    
    Add expected payout for mixed strategies 
    
    Align styled buttons
    
    Try and combine all nasheqs into a single statement 
  
  
    Center input in textfields
  
    Update routes to /api/... to make it more cooperative with router and deploy 
  
    Deploy to nashcalc.com
    
  **Ganesh:**
    
     Responsive static header (fix the spacing problem) -- should just be there no fancy stuff yet 
        Finish tutorial here: https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-basic-header-with-materialui-and-react-js-d650f75b4b0a + next tutorial 
  
  **Unassigned (take what you want and throw it under your name):** 

    Animate adding or removing form cards 
    
    Affix row and col buttons to position on page so they don't move when things are scaled 
    
    Add styling of form 
    
    Scale cards properly 
    
    Make a nice logo maybe (see what we have the rights to do) 
    
    Zoom in and out like google sheets ui: https://blog.logrocket.com/building-inline-editable-ui-in-react/
    
    
    
    When rows exceed height of screen everything scrolls down whereas when columns exceed width everything gets screwed up and they tend to wrap around 
      Get rid of this behavior and make it such that the whole thing can scroll horizontally to account for width expansion 
  
  **Future Features:** 
  
    Take a look at gambit + other libraries for future feature ideas / opportunities 
      
  **Approximate feature roadmap:**
