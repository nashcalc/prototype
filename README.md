  This might be helpful for us both with phase 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgKH12s_95A

**Key Tasks:**
  
  **Ben:**  
  
    Responsive header
    
    Animate adding or removing cards

    nashpy/gambit solve for nash eq 
    
    Affix row and col buttons to position on page so they don't move when things are scaled

  **Future Features:** 
  
    Take a look at nashpy and gambit + other libraries for future feature ideas / opportunities 
      -note that the manner in which we use the python bridge means that we'll have access to other game theory libraries for other features that will all be handled behind the scenes
